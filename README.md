# Transient Prompt

When we have a gorgeous terminal prompt, the terminal will be flooded with these prompts, which will obviously affect our attention to more critical data, such as the execution results of git commands.

The goal of this plugin is to reduce the distraction of these prompts.

This will also make it easier to scroll back and copy-paste a series of commands from the terminal.
